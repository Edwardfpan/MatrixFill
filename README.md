#1. Prove that any square of 2^n x 2^n, can be filled by patterns of the shape ## , ## ,  # , #   , with only one hole.
#                                                                              #     #   ##   ##   
# eg. when n=2, ####     n=3  ########
#               ####          # ######
#               # ##          ########
#               ####          ########
#                             ########
#                             ########
#                             ########
#                             ########

#2. Write a program, by giving 'n', and the location of the hole, 'Hole_h', 'Hole_v', to list the position of the filling patterns,
# and their orientation, such that the square 2^n x 2^n can be fully filled with the only hole at (Hole_h, Hole_v).
